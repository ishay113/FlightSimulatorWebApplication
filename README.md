## Application Features
There are 2 main features of our app:
The first is the web app that is opened through your browser of choice, in which you should navigate to http://localhost:8080/ .
Once opened, the user uploads the flight data files, one for training the algorithm and one for testing. The user should also choose between two modes - regression / hybrid.
Afterwards, the user will click the "Detect!" button and the results will be retrieved to the screen as shown below:

The second feature is giving the user the option to send an HTTP POST request to the sever, the request should include the details for which algorithm to use.
The user will add append a propper CSV files for training the algorithm and for the detection of the anomalies in the test file. The server response will be the detected anomalies as a JSON format.
